goal=helping the user to navigate across a large image.  When there is a large image containing hundreds of object of different sizes, it is difficult to keep track of what part of the image has been explored

We propose to implement a customizable grid (e.g., 20Ã—10), where user defines a grid to be overlaid on the image. This grid is not a ROI but a reference guide.
