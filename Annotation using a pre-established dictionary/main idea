The main idea is to standardize and simplify the annotation process for ROIs within each project by using a predefined dictionary of terms.

To achieve this:

Currently, we already have such a dictionary implemented as a Google extension, but our goal is to integrate this dictionary directly into OMERO.

Make this dictionary available directly in the ROI annotation field, so users can select terms instead of typing free text.
