The main idea behind this code is to facilitate the search and comparison of annotations by shape, allowing users to find specific regions more quickly and in a more organized manner.

To achieve this, we propose:

- Allowing annotations to be searched by shape type (e.g., circles, rectangles, polygons, etc.).

- Display the results in a grid view, where each result is presented in an individual box, side by side.
